# Stroke Prediction
This project explores binary classification algorithms such as **support vector classifier and random forest classifier.** The objective of this project is to identify patients with a stroke.

# Dataset
The dataset is downlaoded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

# Approach
The dataset will be process before it is used for training. The null values in the dataset will be fill with the mean values. One-hot encoding will be used to encode the dataset so that the dataset is "readable" by the machine.
